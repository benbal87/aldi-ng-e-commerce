# Angular 18 Application

This is a simple Angular 18 application created as a technical interview task for a programming company.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version used: `20.18.0 LTS`. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **NPM**: Version used: `10.9.0`. NPM is installed with Node.js.
- **Angular CLI**: Version used: `18.2.7`. Install Angular CLI globally by running the command:
  ```sh
  npm install -g @angular/cli@18.2.7
  ```
- **Project Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

## How to Use the Application

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use:

- `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.
